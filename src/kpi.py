"""Headline KPIs for Nuclear-DC (v2.7 KPI set, plan §D).

  1. TAC (passthrough)
  2. Net levelized cost of IT supply ($/MWh_e delivered to IT; net TAC over
     IT energy — includes cooling capital, carbon cost, PTC and export
     netting, so it is NOT a generation LCOE)
  3. LCOC ($/MWh_c delivered as chilled water)
  4. Heat-Recovery Premium (free function — needs two TACs)
  5. Annual CO2 (passthrough)
  6. EPBT (years, energy payback time — Lenzen 2008 / IAEA 2018 method)
  7. Water footprint, three-tier (v2.7 upgrade):
        7a. Direct site water (L/MWh_e_IT) — cooling-tower makeup at the DC
            (VCC + absorption-chiller Q_reject side)
        7b. Indirect generation water (L/MWh_e_IT) — Macknick 2012 weighted
            by the power-source mix
        7c. Scarcity-weighted total (m3 world-eq/MWh_e_IT) — multiplied by
            the AWARE / Aqueduct scarcity factor for the host basin (ERCOT
            South Hub baseline 0.65; world-mean reference = 1.0)

The static carbon-abatement-cost KPI was retired: with merchant exports
credited at the grid AEF its denominator is dominated by off-site
displacement rather than load decarbonization, and it is algebraically the
same quantity as the carbon-price crossover the paper already reports.
