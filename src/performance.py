1.0 at full load) so they can be applied on top of the model's own full-load

rather than the absolute values in the source datasets, which sit on a
different efficiency basis.

# segment is the typical CCGT shape; below the ~40% gas-turbine stable-load
# point the curve steepens sharply (inlet-bleed heating, falling firing
# temperature, bottoming-cycle starvation — see Kehlhofer et al.,
# Combined-Cycle Gas & Steam Turbine Power Plants, 3rd ed., part-load
# characteristics), so the low-load branch is extended rather than
# flat-extrapolated. Relative heat-rate multiplier, 1.0 at full load.
